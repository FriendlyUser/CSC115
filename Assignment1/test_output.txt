The tests are checking the best place to align the second string with the first string. Then, the program will print the index corresponding the to the best alignment and the number of mismatched characters. If none of the characters in the strings match, the program will print out nomatch.

The first test input was java SeqAlignment --file tests/in01.txt. Expected output: 150 
								           output: 150

The second test input was java SeqAlignment --file tests/in02.txt. Expected output: 130 
								            output: 130

The third test input was java SeqAlignment --file tests/in03.txt . Expected output: 121 
								            output: 121

The fourth test input was java SeqAlignment --file tests/in04.txt . Expected output: 21 
								             output: 21

The fifth test input was java SeqAlignment --file tests/in05.txt . Expected output: 230 
								            output: 230

The sixth test input was java SeqAlignment --file tests/in06.txt. Expected output: 32 
								           output: 32

The seventh test input was java SeqAlignment --file tests/in07.txt. Expected output: 270 
								             output: 270

The eighth test input was java SeqAlignment --file tests/in08.txt. Expected output: 272 
								            output: 272

The ninth test input was java SeqAlignment --file tests/in09.txt. Expected output: nomatch7
								           output: nomatch7

The tenth test input was java SeqAlignment --file tests/in10.txt. Expected output: 731
