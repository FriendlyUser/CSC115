The program Sports.java uses the classes located in a directory
named csc115a/. This directory's files are in the ZIP file (csc115a.zip).

In order to compile Sports.java, use the normal command:

    javac Sports.java

To compile code within the csc115a directory, however, you must do
something different. For example, to compile BinaryTreeRefBased.java
we would use:

    javac csc115a/BinaryTreeRefBased.java

and to run this class with its main (i.e., test routines) we would
use:

    java csc115a.BinaryTreeRefBased
